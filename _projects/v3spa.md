[SELinux](https://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page) and [SE for Android](https://source.android.com/security/selinux) are important access control systems available in Linux and integrated in Android, but designing and maintaining the policy rules can be challenging for policy administrators because of the number of rules in each policy. I contributed to a research project that experimented with visual analytics help understand policy structure, rules associated with policy denials, and differences between versions of a policy.
