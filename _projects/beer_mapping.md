I made this interactive data-journalism style visualization from data I extracted and analyzed from [The Beer Mapping Project](http://beermapping.com/), a database of beer locations throughout America. The visualization explores five types of locations (beer bars, beer stores, breweries, brewpubs, and homebrew stores). The design is a balance of author-driven and reader-driven: the visualization guides readers through several insights, such as homebrew stores existing in Alabama and Mississippi at a time that homebrewing was illegal there, but also provides freeform exploration of the US states and beer-related location types.
