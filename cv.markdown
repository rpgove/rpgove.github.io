<h3>Experience</h3>
<h4>Distinguished Data Visualization Scientist - Two Six Technologies: <span class="subheader">Dec 2013 - Present</span></h4>
- Performed as PI and technical lead on several programs. Set direction for technical R&D efforts, managed project schedule, performed customer briefings, and created progress reports.
- Performed requirements gathering with end users to determine user interface specifications.
- Designed scalable visualization techniques for analyzing large graph datasets, comparing malware
features, identifying changes in security policies, and explaining machine learning algorithms.
- Combined machine learning and statistical algorithms with visualization to provide force multiplier
tools for analysts.
- Designed and evaluated novel visualization algorithms that dramatically improved runtime
performance over current state-of-the-art algorithms.
- Implemented visual analytic tools in HTML/CSS, D3, Svelte, AngularJS, Python, MongoDB, and Docker.
- Designed and conducted evaluations to evaluate efficacy of user interfaces and visualizations.
- Published papers and presentations at conferences such as EuroVis, VizSec, and Black Hat.
<h4>Analytic Tool Developer - Booz Allen Hamilton: <span class="subheader">June 2011 - Dec 2013</span></h4>
- Designed and implemented novel data visualizations of uncertain project schedules using Flex.
Wrote research report and presented results at IEEE VIS.
- Led teams of developers to design, prototype, implement, test, and deploy tools to government
clients to analyze communication networks, aircrew readiness, and emergency planning.
- Performed requirements gathering with internal and external clients. Worked with clients to
iteratively design user interfaces and visualizations to meet client data analysis needs.
Implemented solutions using D3, jQuery, JavaScript, and Flex.
- Received five awards for producing exceptional project deliverables and presentations.
