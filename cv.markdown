<h3>Experience</h3>
<h4>Distinguished Data Visualization Engineer - Two Six Technologies: <span class="subheader">Dec 2013 - Present</span></h4>
- Performed as PI, tech lead, and front end engineer on numerous projects. Set direction for technical efforts, managed project schedule, performed customer briefings, and mentored junior staff.
- Designed a cyber security incident report timeline visualization tool, gathered user feedback, and developed a summarization algorithm that reduces data size 79% and increases precision 41% (JS/HTML/CSS, D3, Flask, Python). VizSec Best Paper Award; TVCG and PacificVis papers.
- Led a machine learning research team to develop a system that increases t-SNE embedding accuracy 8% by predicting optimal t-SNE hyperparameters for a given data set (Python, sklearn, Pandas, Jupyter).
- Performed requirements gathering, created mockups, conducted user feedback sessions, and managed a front end engineer to develop a Chrome plugin and GitHub dashboard for analyzing code repository risks. VDA Best Paper Award.
- Designed and evaluated novel graph layout algorithms that reduced runtime 18% - 76% using dynamic approximation updates and random sampling (JS, D3). FMT Best Paper Award; EuroVis paper.
- Developed a graph exploration tool using a rank-by-feature framework, reduced graph featurization time to O(n), and sped up rendering by using tile pyramids (JS/HTML/CSS/SASS, D3, Leaflet, AngularJS, Python, NetworkX, MongoDB, Docker). IV Best Paper Award.

<h4>Analytic Tool Developer - Booz Allen Hamilton: <span class="subheader">June 2011 - Dec 2013</span></h4>
- Designed and implemented novel data visualizations of uncertain project schedules using Flex.
Wrote research report and presented results at IEEE VIS.
- Led teams of developers to design, prototype, implement, test, and deploy tools to government
clients to analyze communication networks, aircrew readiness, and emergency planning.
- Performed requirements gathering with internal and external clients. Worked with clients to
iteratively design user interfaces and visualizations to meet client data analysis needs.
Implemented solutions using D3, jQuery, JavaScript, and Flex.
- Received five awards for producing exceptional project deliverables and presentations.
