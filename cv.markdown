<h3>Experience</h3>
<h4>Senior Data Visualization Engineer - CrowdStrike
<span class="subheader">June 2022 - Present</span></h4>
- Engineered scalable UI solutions to analyze data sets with millions of events.
- Designed internal and external customer-facing UIs in collaboration with cyber security analysts.

<h4>Distinguished Data Visualization Engineer - Two Six Technologies: <span class="subheader">Dec 2013 - May 2022</span></h4>
- Performed as PI, tech lead, and front end engineer on numerous projects. Set direction for technical efforts, managed project schedule, performed customer briefings, and mentored junior staff.
- Designed and engineered an incident report visualization tool, and developed a summarization algorithm that reduces data size 79% and increases precision 41% (JS/HTML/CSS, D3, Flask, Python).
- Led a machine learning team to develop a system that increases t-SNE embedding accuracy 8% by predicting optimal t-SNE hyperparameters (Python, sklearn, Pandas, Jupyter).
- Performed requirements gathering, created mockups, conducted user feedback sessions, and managed a front end engineer to develop a GitHub dashboard for analyzing code repository risks.
- Designed and evaluated novel graph layout algorithms that reduced runtime 18% - 76% using dynamic approximation updates and random sampling (JS, D3).
- Developed a graph exploration tool using a rank-by-feature framework, reduced graph featurization time to O(n), and sped up rendering by using tile pyramids (JS/HTML/CSS/SASS, D3, Leaflet, AngularJS, Python, NetworkX, MongoDB, Docker).

<h4>Analytic Tool Developer - Booz Allen Hamilton: <span class="subheader">June 2011 - Dec 2013</span></h4>
