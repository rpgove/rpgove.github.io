# About Me

I am a data visualization engineer at [Two Six Technologies](https://www.twosixtech.com). There I design and develop visual analytic tools, primarily for cyber security analysts.

I enjoy designing and developing innovative data analysis tools. Most recently I've worked in the areas of data summarization, graph visualization, high-dimensional visualization, and machine learning for optimizing visualizations. I've published several [blog posts](/blogs/) and [papers](/publications/) about [projects](/projects/) on these and other topics. I've released some of those projects open source, which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/rpgove).

When I retire I plan to open a bakery with an adjoining yoga studio, which I will call Om Nom Nomaste.
