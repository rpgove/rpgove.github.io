# About Me

I am a Distinguished Data Visualization Scientist at [Two Six Technologies](https://www.twosixtech.com). There I design and develop visual analytic tools primarily for cyber security analysts.

I enjoy R&D in the areas of graph visualization, high-dimensional visualization, and machine learning applied to visualization. I've published several [papers](/publications/) about [projects](/projects/) on these and other topics, and I've released some of those projects [open source](https://www.github.com/rpgove).

When I retire I plan to open a bakery with an adjoining yoga studio, which I will call Om Nom Nomaste.
